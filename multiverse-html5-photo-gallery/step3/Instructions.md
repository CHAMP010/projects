Let's start adding styles to our page. 

Flexbox layout is a best way to arrange elements in a flexible way on a single direction. It is a great way to organize your page and make it responsive across all viewports. 

1. Making the `#gallery-container` to a flex container. 

    Our agenda is to make the images responsive and occupy the whole width of the page. To do that, we need to make the `#gallery-container` to a flex container. 

    ```css
    #gallery-container {
        display: flex;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
    }
    ```
