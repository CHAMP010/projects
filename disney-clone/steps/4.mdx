# Step 4 - Building the movie sections

1. Create a new section tag and give it a class name "movie-section", we will use this section element to build the first movies section : `Recommended for You`
1. Create a h5 element for the section heading and give it a class name "move-heading" and text "Recommended for You"
1. Create a new div for as the container for the movie cards, give it a class name "movie-container"
1. Create four new div elements inside the .movie-container and give them a class "movie"
1. Add the images inside each div element from the `assets/recommended-for-you` folder
1. Add appropriate styles to the section and the container. Make sure to use the correct classes as the selectors. Make sure that the cards are responsive all the major viewports as mentioned earlier.
   1. Making the .movie-container a flexbox container
   1. Make sure that all the movie div elements have the right spacing and the images fit inside the div element
   1. Add the flex-wrap property to the movie-container to make the section responsive

Now that you have built the `Recommended for you` section, build the rest of the movie sections by following the above mentioned steps. As you have already written the CSS styles you can now re-use the HTML classes and the styles will be applied to all the sections.
